# A nix flake for installing GHDL on Arm Mac

This is a simple git repository which has an
installation procedure for a reasonable-ish
terminal environment for installing and running
ghdl and gtkwave. 

I also install starship, because the default
prompt makes it a tad hard to understand what 
environment we are in.
